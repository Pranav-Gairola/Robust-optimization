This repository implements classical and robust versions of three well-known combinatorial optimization problems using Python and [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/):

- ‚úÖ 0-1 Knapsack Problem (Deterministic and Robust)
- ‚úÖ Set Covering Problem (Deterministic and Robust)
- ‚úÖ p-Median Facility Location Problem (Deterministic and Robust)

These scripts are designed for educational, research, and prototyping purposes.

üìå Problem Descriptions

1. 0-1 Knapsack Problem
Goal: Select a subset of items to maximize total profit without exceeding a weight capacity.

Deterministic: Uses nominal weights.

Robust: Handles uncertainty in item weights using the Bertsimas-Sim budgeted uncertainty model.

üî¢ Example:

Profits: [10, 7, 5, 8, 11]

Weights: [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]

Deviations: [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]

Capacity: 15, Budget Œì: 2

2. Set Covering Problem
Goal: Select a subset of facilities to cover all required demand nodes at minimum cost.

Deterministic: Each demand node must be covered by at least one facility.

Robust: Handles uncertainty in demand node coverage (e.g., disruptions) using dualization of budgeted uncertainty.

üß© Example: Coverage matrix, costs, and demand data defined in-code.

3. p-Median Facility Location Problem
Goal: Choose p facility locations to minimize the total distance from demand points to the nearest open facility.

Deterministic: All data is fixed and known.

Robust: Demand or cost matrix can vary within an uncertainty budget, using robust dual constraints.

üìç Example: Solves a toy p-median instance with demand and cost matrix embedded.
