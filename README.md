# Classical and Robust Combinatorial Optimization Models

This repository implements classical and robust versions of three well-known combinatorial optimization problems using Python and [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/):

- ✅ 0-1 Knapsack Problem (Deterministic and Robust)
- ✅ Set Covering Problem (Deterministic and Robust)
- ✅ p-Median Facility Location Problem (Deterministic and Robust)

These scripts are designed for educational, research, and prototyping purposes.
